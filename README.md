# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This week we worked with Pyber to utilize Matplolib to create a variety of graphics that we used to analyze ride share prices by city type, driver quantity, and customer volume.
## Purpose
For this project we used Jupyter notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create a summary by city type from the ride share data csv. We also created a graph comparing the total weekly fare by city types. 
## Results
There was a significantly lower amount of total rides and drivers for Rural and Suburban cities than Urban ones. The average fare per ride was higher for Suburban and Rural drivers. The average fare per driver was significantly higher in Rural and Suburban cities.
